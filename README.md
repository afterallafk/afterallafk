- I have started my journey in Android Development and ROM Building from June 2021. I used to flash ROMS from year 2019 earlier before that I have ported recoveries for mediatek phones. When I started to flash ROMS I just got curious that how ROMS were builded so just researched the internet and guides and started my journey from there.
